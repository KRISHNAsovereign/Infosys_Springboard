High Volume of Pending Tickets for Technical Issues

Technical issues are the most frequent ticket type, with many unresolved or awaiting customer responses. Common subjects include product setup, network problems, and hardware issues, often leading to delays in resolution.
Potential Solution: Implement automated responses or self-help guides for common technical issues to reduce pending tickets.



Critical Priority Tickets Often Originate from Social Media

A significant proportion of critical tickets are submitted through social media channels, such as those related to refunds, billing inquiries, and product inquiries.
Insight: This indicates social media is a primary channel for urgent customer concerns, necessitating faster response times.



Customer Satisfaction is Lowest for Billing and Payment Issues

Tickets related to billing inquiries, such as account access or payment issues, have low customer satisfaction ratings (as low as 1.0 in several cases).
Actionable Step: Automate billing-related inquiries and integrate GenAI-powered chat to provide instant solutions or escalate cases efficiently.
